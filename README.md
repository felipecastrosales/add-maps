<h2 align="center">About 📖</h2>
   
<p align="center">
   This is a simple demonstration of a Map using Flutter and using the <a href="https://cloud.google.com/maps-platform/maps?hl=pt">Google Maps API</a>.<br>
   I made this simple application following the <a href=https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/google-maps-in-flutter#0>Google Codelabs tutorial</a>, and the step by step is very simple.

<h2 align="center">Challenges and Learnings along the way 🤯</h2>

   <p>
   This application was quite simple, to be honest.<br>
   The tutorial that Google itself made available was of great help, and the problems I had were not so many, the ones that appeared, I was able to solve easily.<br>
   This was another great exprience using Flutter, and I really liked it!
